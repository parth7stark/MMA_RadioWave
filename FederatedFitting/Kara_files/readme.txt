I have the fitting script for you. I pushed it to the repo, it is: https://gitlab.com/karamerfeld1/ai4mma/-/blob/main/parameter_exploration/with_ini.py?ref_type=heads. You can run it with the command: python with_ini.py --ini_file_path ./test_ini.ini. This reads the .ini file (test_ini.ini) and runs the fitting accordingly. In the parameters file there are all of the fitting parameters (number of walkers, iterations, burn-in, etc) and all of the parameters of the system that we fit. There is also a save folder (currently set to ./with_ini/), a run_name parameter which sets how all of the posteriors and plots are names within the save folder, and a plot_names parameter which controls the names of the plots produced. Then everything is saved in /with_ini/. I have a seed set so you can replicate my run if you like, all you would have to do is change run_name to 'example2' in the .ini file and you should get identical everything.
I also set up a folder, /parameter_exploration/federated_test/ which has everything to do the federated part of this. In here, I've broken the data file into a separate file for each user, given each user an output directory for everything to be saved in, and given each user a .ini file which points to both their data .csv file and their save folder. I set the default run_name to 'runN', where N can be the number of days that we use in the fit. This will save all posteriors for the same user in the same folder with different names. So you would run these with: python with_ini.py --ini_file_path ./federated_test/Alexander.ini, and similarly for the other users.
