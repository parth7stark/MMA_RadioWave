"""
MMA_GW  is part of a Multimessenger App designed to analyze data from different astronomical sources. In multimessenger astronomy, signals from various messengers—such as gravitational waves, radio waves, and electromagnetic waves—are combined to gain a more comprehensive understanding of astrophysical phenomena.

This repo specifically contains files and code related to gravitational wave data analysis, forming one of the core components of the overall multimessenger workflow. The app integrates these data streams with other repositories handling gravitational wave analysis to create a unified event detection and analysis framework.

The framework is designed to run on a single machine (laptop or cluster) for simulation as well as multiple heterogeneous machines for real deployment.
