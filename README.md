# Multimessenger App - Radio Wave Data

## Overview
This repository is part of a **Multimessenger App** designed to analyze data from different astronomical sources. In multimessenger astronomy, signals from various messengers—such as gravitational waves, radio waves, and electromagnetic waves—are combined to gain a more comprehensive understanding of astrophysical phenomena.

This repo specifically contains files and code related to **radio wave data** analysis, forming one of the core components of the overall multimessenger workflow. The app integrates these data streams with other repositories handling gravitational wave analysis to create a unified event detection and analysis framework.

## Todo List and Project Plan

## Related Projects
This repo focuses on radio wave data. For gravitational wave analysis, please visit [Gravitational Wave Analysis Repo](https://github.com/parth7stark/GW_VerticalFL/tree/main). Together, these repositories work within the multimessenger framework to capture and analyze various cosmic events.

## Future Plans
- Integration of additional messenger types (e.g., neutrinos, gamma rays)
- Real-time data streaming and event detection
- Cross-correlation between different datasets for enhanced analysis
