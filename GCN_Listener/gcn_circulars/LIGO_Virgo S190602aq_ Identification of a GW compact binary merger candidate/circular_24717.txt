    "body": "The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration report:\n\nWe identified the compact binary merger candidate S190602aq during\nreal-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO\nLivingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2019-06-02\n17:59:27.089 UTC (GPS time: 1243533585.089). The candidate was found\nby the PyCBC Live [1], CWB [2], SPIIR [3], GstLAL [4], and MBTAOnline\n[5] analysis pipelines.\n\nS190602aq is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as\nestimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-09 Hz, or about one in 16\nyears. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190602aq\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending\nprobability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), BNS (<1%), NSBH (<1%),\nor MassGap (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, there is strong\nevidence against the lighter compact object having a mass < 3 solar\nmasses (HasNS: <1%). Using the masses and spins inferred from the\nsignal, there is strong evidence against matter outside the final\ncompact object (HasRemnant: <1%).\n\nOne skymap is available at this time and can be retrieved from the\nGraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.fits.gz, an updated localization generated by BAYESTAR\n[6], distributed via GCN notice about 6 minutes after the candidate\n\nFor the bayestar.fits.gz skymap, the 90% credible region is 1172 deg2.\nMarginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance\nestimate is 797 +/- 238 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard\ndeviation).\n\nFor further information about analysis methodology and the contents of\nthis alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts User Guide\n<https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/>.\n\n [1] Nitz et al.
