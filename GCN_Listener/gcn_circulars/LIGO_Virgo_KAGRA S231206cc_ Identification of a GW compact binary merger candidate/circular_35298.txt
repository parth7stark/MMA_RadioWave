    "body": "The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration report:\n\nWe identified the compact binary merger candidate S231206cc during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2023-12-06 23:39:01.498 UTC (GPS time: 1385941159.498). The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL [2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.\n\nS231206cc is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-35 Hz, or about one in 1e27 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S231206cc\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), NSBH (<1%), BNS (<1%), or Terrestrial (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassgap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 30 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,2 sky map, the 90% credible region is 445 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 1261 +/- 294 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).\n\nFor further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Public Alerts User Guide https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/.\n\n [1] Klimenko et al.
