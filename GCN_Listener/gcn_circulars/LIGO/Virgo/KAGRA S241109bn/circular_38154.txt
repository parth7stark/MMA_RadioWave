Liu (NAO, CAS) report on behalf of the Einstein Probe team:\n\nAfter the trigger of the gravitational-wave (GW) event S241109bn (LVK Collaboration, GCN 38142), we examined the data of Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board the Einstein Probe (EP). The 90% credible region of the GW event was occulted by the earth until about 20 minutes after the GW trigger time. The field of view of WXT covered 4.4% of the 90% credible region of the event (598 square degrees) with a duration of about 200 s. The 5-sigma upper limit of the observation in 0.5-4 keV is around 9 x 10^(-11) erg/cm^2/s.\n\nTwo target-of-opportunity observations by WXT was carried out about 30 minutes and 2 hours after the trigger, beginning at 2024-11-09 12:28:01 (UTC) and 2024-11-09 14:04:15 (UTC) and lasting for around 2800 s and 2400 s, respectively. 59.2% of the 90% credible region of the event was covered by these two observations, with a total area of 5811 square degrees. No new X-ray source is found in these observations. These two observations set 5-sigma upper limits on the 0.5-4 keV flux in the credible region to be approximately 1.3 x 10^(-11) erg/cm^2/s and 1.4 x 10^(-11) erg/cm^2/s, respectively. For queries on more information about these observations and the upper limits, please contact Xuan Mao at the EP science center (ep_ta@nao.cas.cn).\n\nLaunched on January 9, 2024, EP is a space X-ray observatory to monitor the soft X-ray sky with onboard X-ray follow-up capability (Yuan et al. 2022, Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astrophysics). EP is an international collaborative mission led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and participated by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Germany and the Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (CNES) in France.
