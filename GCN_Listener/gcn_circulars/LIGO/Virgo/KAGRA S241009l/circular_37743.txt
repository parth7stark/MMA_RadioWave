    "body": "\nThe LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration report:\n\nWe identified the compact binary merger candidate S241009l during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2024-10-09 02:28:35.687 UTC (GPS time: 1412476133.687). The candidate was found by the GstLAL [1] and MBTA [2] analysis pipelines.\n\nS241009l is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 3.3e-08 Hz, or about one in 11 months. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S241009l\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (98%), Terrestrial (2%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [3] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [3] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state for maximum neutron star mass. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassGap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [4], distributed via GCN notice about 27 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [4], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,2 sky map, the 90% credible region is 2544 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 6642 +/- 2029 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).\n\nFor further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Public Alerts User Guide https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/.\n\n [1] Tsukada et al.
