    "body": "IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:\n\nWe have performed a search for track-like muon neutrino candidate events detected by IceCube consistent with the sky localization of the low-significance gravitational-wave candidate event S241106ba in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2024-11-06 15:23:26 UTC to 2024-11-06 15:40:06 UTC) [1,2]. During this time period, IceCube was collecting good quality data. A single hypothesis test was conducted using a Bayesian approach to quantify the joint GW + neutrino event significance, which assumes a binary merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical priors, such as GW source distance, in the statistical significance estimation [3].  \n\nOne track-like event was found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the gravitational-wave candidate S241106ba calculated from the map circulated in the S241106ba-2-Preliminary notice. This represents an overall p-value of 0.0042 for the Bayesian search. The p-value measures the consistency of the observed track-like event with the known atmospheric backgrounds for this single map (not accounting for statistical trials from multiple GW events). \n\nFurther details are available at https://gcn.nasa.gov/missions/icecube and at https://roc.icecube.wisc.edu/public/LvkNuTrackSearch.\n\nProperties of the coincident event are shown below:\n\n dt(s)     RA(deg)       Dec(deg)    Angular uncertainty(deg)  p-value(Bayesian)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n -137.94    210.20\t   20.74            \t1.84\t\t\t0.0046\n\nwhere:\ndt = Time of track event minus time of GW trigger (sec)\nAngular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a circle \n     representing 90% CL containment by area.\np-value = the p-value for this specific track event from this search.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the \ngeographic South Pole, Antarctica.
