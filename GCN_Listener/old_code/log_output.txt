One cataloged >100 MeV gamma-ray source is located within the 90% NuEm-240926A localization error, at a distance of roughly 0.12 deg (Fourth Fermi-LAT catalog, 4FGL-DR4, The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2023, arXiv:2307.12546). This is the object 4FGL J0959.6+4606 likely associated with the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy SDSS J095909.51+460014.3 (Li et al. 2023, A&A, 676, A9). Based on a preliminary analysis of the LAT data over the-timescales of 6.06 hours, 1-day and 1-month prior to T0, this object is not significantly detected at gamma-rays.\n\nWe searched for short (hours to month) timescale emission from a new gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the NuEm-240926A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the NuEm-240926A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 2.8e-7 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~6.06 hours, < 1.0e-7  ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-day and < 4.6e-9 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month integration time before T0.\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. For these observations, the Fermi-LAT contact person is Patrik M. Veres (veres at astro.ruhr-uni-bochum.de). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

We started observations in the g- and r-band beginning at 2024-10-08 07:00 UTC, approximately 32.4 hours after event time. We covered 76.0% (1.3 sq deg) of the reported localization region. This estimate accounts for chip gaps. Each exposure was 300s with a typical depth of 21.0 mag. \n \nThe images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019, Stein et al. 2021) was used to search the alerts database for candidates. We reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects, and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We are left with the following high-significance transient candidates by our pipeline, all lying within the 90.0% localization of the skymap.\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| ZTF Name     | IAU Name  | RA (deg)    | DEC (deg)   | Filter | Mag   | MagErr |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| ZTF19accjndb |  -------  | 058.6439041 | +08.5812604 | g      | 20.59 | 0.12    \n| ZTF24ablklut |  -------  | 058.2043689 | +08.6628184 | r      | 21.69 | 0.18   |  \n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n \n\nAmongst our candidates, \n\nZTF19accjndb was first detected on 2019-09-09, and has a crossmatched detection as WISEA J035434.54+083452.2 at a distance of 0.35\". This source is also listed in milliquas (Flesch 2023) as a likely QSO (p=98%). This AGN has been detected previously by ZTF, and does not appear to currently be in an elevated optical state. It had been gradually fading in difference image detections for the past 60 days, and these represent minor fluctations relative to the archival PS1 magnitude of g=18.6 (Chambers et al. 2016). \n\nZTF24ablklut was first detected on 2024-10-08. It has a cross-matched detection as WISEA J035249.06+083946.1 at a distance of  0.19\". Based on the archival MIR colours of this source (W1-W2=1.0), this object is very likely to be an AGN (Stern et al. 2012). The recent optical detection is very faint in difference imaging, representing a small increase relative to the archival detection in PS1 at r=20.5 (Chambers et al. 2016).\n\nWe therefore find no reason to suggest that either ZTF19accjndb/WISEA J035434.54+083452.2 or ZTF24ablklut/WISEA J035249.06+083946.1 are related to the neutrino.\n\nObservations of this field will continue as part of our standard ToO cadence for high-energy neutrinos (Stein et al 2023.).\n\nZTF and GROWTH are worldwide collaborations comprising Caltech, USA; IPAC, USA; WIS, Israel; OKC, Sweden; JSI/UMd, USA; DESY, Germany; TANGO, Taiwan; UW Milwaukee, USA; LANL, USA; TCD, Ireland; IN2P3, France.\n\nGROWTH acknowledges generous support of the NSF under PIRE Grant No 1545949.\nAlert distribution service provided by DIRAC@UW (Patterson et al. 2019).\nAlert database searches are done by AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019).\nAlert filtering is performed with the nuztf (Stein et al. 2021, https://github.com/desy-multimessenger/nuztf ).","createdOn":1728420424577}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"GRB 241008A","submitter":"Fermi GBM Team at MSFC/Fermi-GBM <do_not_reply@GIOC.nsstc.nasa.gov>","submittedHow":"email","subject":"GRB 241008A: Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization","circularId":37740,"body":"The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB\n\nAt 22:00:04 UT on 8 Oct 2024, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 241008A (trigger 750117609.348226 / 241008917).\n\nThe on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 112.9, Dec = -14.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 07h 31m, -14d 30'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.0 degrees.\n\nThe angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 77.0 degrees.\n\nThe skymap can be found here:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2024/bn241008917/quicklook/glg_skymap_all_bn241008917.png\n\nThe HEALPix FITS file, including the estimated localization systematic, can be found here:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2024/bn241008917/quicklook/glg_healpix_all_bn241008917.fit\n\nThe GBM light curve can be found here:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2024/bn241008917/quicklook/glg_lc_medres34_bn241008917.gif\n\n","createdOn":1728425436485}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"GRB 241008A","submitter":"Jochen Greiner at MPE <jcgrog@mpe.mpg.de>","submittedHow":"email","subject":"GRB 241008A: BALROG localization (Fermi Trigger 750117609 / GRB 241008917)","circularId":37741,"body":"T.

The data comprise 9 s in Windowed Timing\n(WT) mode (taken while Swift was slewing), with the remainder in Photon\nCounting (PC) mode. \n\nThe light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The\ninitial decay index is alpha=3.3 (+4.0, -0.9). At T+154 s  the decay\nflattens to an alpha of 0.1 (+0.3, -0.4). The light curve breaks again\nat T+535 s to a decay with alpha=5.2 (+2.8, -3.4),  and  again at T+677\ns s to alpha=-0.6 (+0.4, -0.9),  before a final break at T+3672 s s\nafter which the decay index is 0.92 (+0.14, -0.05).\n\nA spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed\npower-law with a photon spectral index of 1.91 (+/-0.13). The\nbest-fitting absorption column is  2.0 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2, in\nexcess of the Galactic value of 3.9 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.\n2013).

Using 433 s of PC mode data and 1\nUVOT image, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT\nalignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):\nRA, Dec = 325.00866, -35.65944 which is equivalent to:\n\nRA (J2000): 21h 40m 02.08s\nDec(J2000): -35d 39' 34.0\"\n\nwith an uncertainty of 4.2 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This\nposition is 6.3 arcmin from the SVOM/ECLAIRs position. The source has\nfaded from a count rate of 0.0441 [+0.013, -0.011] ct s^-1 at T0+14.9\nks to an upper limit of 0.0132 ct s^-1 at T0+100.9 ks.\n\nThe results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at\nhttp://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/00021722.\nThe results of the full analysis of the XRT observations are available\nat https://www.swift.ac.uk/ToO_GRBs/00021722.\n\nThis circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.\n\n","createdOn":1728661660796}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"GRB 241009A","submitter":"Thomas Hussenot-Desenonges at IJCLab <thomas.hussenot@ijclab.in2p3.fr>","submittedHow":"web","subject":"GRB 241009A: GRANDMA optical upper limits","circularId":37773,"format":"text/plain","body":"T.

Images obtained with Sloan filters were calibrated using the SkyMapper DR4 catalog. The unfiltered image taken by TAROT-TRE was calibrated as a Gaia G image using the Gaia eDR3 catalogue.\n\nAll the data have been reduced by a single data processing pipeline, STDPipe (Karpov et al., 2022).

The candidate was found by the GstLAL [1] analysis pipeline.\n\nS241011k is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 2.5e-34 Hz, or about one in 1e26 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S241011k\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), NSBH (<1%), Terrestrial (<1%), or BNS (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [2] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [2] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state for maximum neutron star mass. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassGap) is 3%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 28 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,1 sky map, the 90% credible region is 76 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 232 +/- 51 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).\n\nFor further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Public Alerts User Guide https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/.\n\n [1] Tsukada et al.

The weighted location of the 7 remaining triggers is centered\non R.A. = 16h27m12.0s and dec = -41d06.0' with an error radius of\nabout 2 degrees.  This location does not correspond to any previously\nknown SGR source; we conclude that we have discovered a new source,\nSGR1627-41.

The total exposure time was 7080\nseconds in the 50CCD aperture. The images were reduced by the standard\nHST pipeline, and drizzled to a combined image with a pixelscale of\n0.\"0254.\n\nWe projected the location of the early afterglow from a KeckII/LRIS R\nband image, taken by Filippenko, Leonard and Riess on March 27, 1998\n(see GCN 33).  We estimate the 1-sigma error radius to be less than 1.5\ndrizzled HST pixels, which includes both the scatter in the\ntransformation (0.9 pixels, using 6 reference stars) and the\nmeasurement error of the transient in the Keck image (0.8 pixels).\n\nWithin one pixel of the estimated position, there was evidence of a\nsmall source.  We therefore convolved the image with a gaussian with a\nFWHM equal to that of the PSF (3.5 drizzled pixels).  This procedure\nuses the PSF as a matched filter to enhance the the signal-to-noise\nratio of unresolved sources.  In the convolved image an object is\nfound, again offset by one pixel from the expected position with a\nsignificance of ~4.5 sigma.  We estimate a magnitude (in the broad STIS\n50ccd filter) of V = 29.25 +/- 0.25.\n\nBloom et al., (1999, Nature, 401, 453) have suggested that the unusual\nlight curve of this GRB might be explained by an underlying supernova,\nand on the basis of this estimated a redshift of about z~1.   A\nsupernova at this redshift (which in this model peaks around a\nmagnitude of 25) would be expected to be significantly fainter than\nV=29 by now (as would the rapidly decaying GRB afterglow).  Therefore,\nwe may be detecting a faint host galaxy.  Deep HST images have in all\nother cases detected a host underlying the GRB, when good astrometry\nwas available for the GRB.  If we are observing a host galaxy, then the\nabove magnitude could underestimate its brightness by as much as a few\ntenths of a magnitude, due to extended emission missed in this\nmeasurement.  A galaxy at a z~1 with this observed magnitude would lie\na rather remarkable 7 magnitudes below L*, the knee of the of the\ngalaxy luminosity function at that redshift.\n\nGiven the apparent point-source nature of the detected object, and the\nlack of color information, we cannot exclude the possibility (which we\nconsider remote) that we are observing a light echo, from either the\nGRB or the supernova.\n\nImages of the field can be found at\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/980326","createdOn":985809183000,"email":"fruchter@stsci.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Sylvia Biscoveanu at MIT <sylvia.biscoveanu@ligo.org>","submittedHow":"web","subject":"LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S231206ca: Updated Sky localization","circularId":35305,"bibcode":"2023GCN.35305....1L","body":"The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration report:\n\nWe have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) data around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S231206ca (GCN Circular 35297).

Woods, PI). We cannot verify the burst reported in GCN #1047. \nThe source was occulted by the earth at the time in question.\n\nWe confirm the burst in the Chandra data at approximately 7:15:25 UT. The burst \nduration appeared to be 0.35 seconds during which 14 counts were recorded \n(ignoring pile-up). Thus the peak count rate was 65 times the quiescent rate.\nAdopting the quiescent source spectrum (GCN # 1046), we estimate the peak flux \nin the 2-10 keV band to be 7.2 x 10^-10 ergs/cm^2 s (2.9 x 10^-9 ergs/cm^2 s in \n0.5-10.0 keV).\n\nWe would like to add a clarification regarding the persistent source flux  \nvalues in the two GCNs (1046, 1047).

This seeming storm of XRBs is being produced by an \nensemble of ~10 distinct XRB sources, which are optimally placed in \nthe HETE field-of-view (FOV) for detectability.\n\nThis dramatic overall increase is due to two factors: 1) Improvements \nin the on-board detection algorithm, resulting from lowered trigger \nthresholds and increased numbers of trigger time scales being \nactivated; 2) Sco X-1 has moved out of the HETE instruments' FOV, \ngreatly reducing the overall background, thus improving the \ninstruments' burst detection efficiency.\n\n(NB: Despite the flurry of XRBs, soft gamma repeaters [SGR] and \ngamma-ray bursts [GRB] positions are now being, and will continue to \nbe, reported for events which trigger the high energy bands of the \nFREGATE instrument directly.)\n\nMany of the faint XRB detections are near threshold, and thus their \nonboard localization is unreliable. In order not to saturate rapid \nresponse telescopes and observing programs which primarily target \nSGRs and GRBs, these XRB events are being reported to the GCN with no \npositions. (In fact, reliable positions are subsequently established \nby the WXM ground software for a large fraction of these XRB events.) \nA  refined reporting algorithm, which will more clearly distinguish \nfainter, poorly-localized XRBs from brighter, well-localized XRBs \nwill be implemented in the near future.

Many people\nare wondering what is going on.  This announcement attempts to explain\nthe recent developments.\n\nTRIGGERS:\nStarting about a week ago, the HETE Operations team resumed sending\nthe HETE messages from the s/c to GCN -- there were gaps due to HETE and due\nto GCN (the network problems).  And since the Galactic Center\nis still in the HETE FOV, this has caused a marked step increase\nin the amount of HETE Notices (from zero to several per day).\nThis increase has been further enhanced by the fact that Sco X-1 has left\nthe FOV of the HETE instruments two weeks ago.  The decrease in the background\ndue to the loss of Sco X-1 has increased the sensitivity to the the XRB\nsources in the Galactic Center.\n\nPOSITIONS:\nSince a larger fraction of these triggers is caused by X-ray Burst sources\nwhich are very weak, they produce poor image detections and therefore\nlocations with large uncertainites.  The HETE Operations team\nhas commanded the s/c to suppress the positions if the \"source\"\nin the image is not significant enough.  This results in the large\nnumber of Notices with no positions.\n\nFILTERING:\nI have changed the GCN filtering system to compensate for this change\nin the Notice content.  If there is no position in the S/C_Update,\nS/C_Last, or even the Gnd_Analysis messages, then they are NOT distributed\nthe sites requesting HETE Notices.  The reasoning is that with no position\ninformation in the Notice, what possible use could a follow-up observer\nmake of the notification.  This change was made Saturday, 28 Jul 01.\n\nTOO MANY ALERTS?\nHowever, the S/C_Alerts never were intended to have position information\n(except for rare instances (~10%)), so they are still being distributed\nto those sites that have requested the HETE S/C_Alert subtype.\nEven with the filtering of the U/L/GA's that have no positions, there are\nstill a large number of Alert Notices being distributed to sites.  If you feel\nthat you are receiving too many Alerts (that subsequently have no U/L/GA\nfollow-ups), then you might consider requesting that the Alert subtype\nbe disabled for your site.  (Or you might consider \"toughing it out\"\nfor another 4-6 weeks until the Galactic Center is no longer in the HETE FOV \nin which case the trigger rate should drop dramatically.)\n\nACTION ITEM:\nSites can:\n1) keep their current configurations,   or\n2) request that S/C_Alerts be disabled,   or\n3) request that S/C_Alerts/Updates/Lasts be disabled (say for the next month\nor so, and then request they be turned back on),   or\n4) request that all HETE subtypes (A/U/L/GA) be disabled (again for the next\nmonth or so).\nGiven the no-positions-filtering incorporated last Saturday, choice \"2\"\nseems like a reasonable approach if a site has any concern about \"too many\nNotices\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Barthelmy\nNASA-GSFC\n301-286-3106\nscott@lheamail.gsfs.nasa.gov","createdOn":996530269000,"email":"scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>","subject":"IPN Triangulation of GRB010412","circularId":1036,"bibcode":"2009GCN.10036....1S","body":"K.

This seeming storm of XRBs is being produced by an \nensemble of ~10 distinct XRB sources, which are optimally placed in \nthe HETE field-of-view (FOV) for detectability.\n\nThis dramatic overall increase is due to two factors: 1) Improvements \nin the on-board detection algorithm, resulting from lowered trigger \nthresholds and increased numbers of trigger time scales being \nactivated; 2) Sco X-1 has moved out of the HETE instruments' FOV, \ngreatly reducing the overall background, thus improving the \ninstruments' burst detection efficiency.\n\n(NB: Despite the flurry of XRBs, soft gamma repeaters [SGR] and \ngamma-ray bursts [GRB] positions are now being, and will continue to \nbe, reported for events which trigger the high energy bands of the \nFREGATE instrument directly.)\n\nMany of the faint XRB detections are near threshold, and thus their \nonboard localization is unreliable.

Many people\nare wondering what is going on.  This announcement attempts to explain\nthe recent developments.\n\nTRIGGERS:\nStarting about a week ago, the HETE Operations team resumed sending\nthe HETE messages from the s/c to GCN -- there were gaps due to HETE and due\nto GCN (the network problems).  And since the Galactic Center\nis still in the HETE FOV, this has caused a marked step increase\nin the amount of HETE Notices (from zero to several per day).\nThis increase has been further enhanced by the fact that Sco X-1 has left\nthe FOV of the HETE instruments two weeks ago.  The decrease in the background\ndue to the loss of Sco X-1 has increased the sensitivity to the the XRB\nsources in the Galactic Center.\n\nPOSITIONS:\nSince a larger fraction of these triggers is caused by X-ray Burst sources\nwhich are very weak, they produce poor image detections and therefore\nlocations with large uncertainites.  The HETE Operations team\nhas commanded the s/c to suppress the positions if the \"source\"\nin the image is not significant enough.  This results in the large\nnumber of Notices with no positions.\n\nFILTERING:\nI have changed the GCN filtering system to compensate for this change\nin the Notice content.  If there is no position in the S/C_Update,\nS/C_Last, or even the Gnd_Analysis messages, then they are NOT distributed\nthe sites requesting HETE Notices.  The reasoning is that with no position\ninformation in the Notice, what possible use could a follow-up observer\nmake of the notification.  This change was made Saturday, 28 Jul 01.\n\nTOO MANY ALERTS?\nHowever, the S/C_Alerts never were intended to have position information\n(except for rare instances (~10%)), so they are still being distributed\nto those sites that have requested the HETE S/C_Alert subtype.\nEven with the filtering of the U/L/GA's that have no positions, there are\nstill a large number of Alert Notices being distributed to sites.  If you feel\nthat you are receiving too many Alerts (that subsequently have no U/L/GA\nfollow-ups), then you might consider requesting that the Alert subtype\nbe disabled for your site.  (Or you might consider \"toughing it out\"\nfor another 4-6 weeks until the Galactic Center is no longer in the HETE FOV \nin which case the trigger rate should drop dramatically.)\n\nACTION ITEM:\nSites can:\n1) keep their current configurations,   or\n2) request that S/C_Alerts be disabled,   or\n3) request that S/C_Alerts/Updates/Lasts be disabled (say for the next month\nor so, and then request they be turned back on),   or\n4) request that all HETE subtypes (A/U/L/GA) be disabled (again for the next\nmonth or so).\nGiven the no-positions-filtering incorporated last Saturday, choice \"2\"\nseems like a reasonable approach if a site has any concern about \"too many\nNotices\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Barthelmy\nNASA-GSFC\n301-286-3106\nscott@lheamail.gsfs.nasa.gov","createdOn":996530269000,"email":"scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Lorenzo Amati at TESRE/CNR  <amati@tesre.bo.cnr.it>","subject":"GRB010412: BeppoSAX GRBM and WFC observations","circularId":1037,"bibcode":"2001GCN..1037....1P","body":"A.

The total exposure time was 7080\nseconds in the 50CCD aperture. The images were reduced by the standard\nHST pipeline, and drizzled to a combined image with a pixelscale of\n0.\"0254.\n\nWe projected the location of the early afterglow from a KeckII/LRIS R\nband image, taken by Filippenko, Leonard and Riess on March 27, 1998\n(see GCN 33).  We estimate the 1-sigma error radius to be less than 1.5\ndrizzled HST pixels, which includes both the scatter in the\ntransformation (0.9 pixels, using 6 reference stars) and the\nmeasurement error of the transient in the Keck image (0.8 pixels).\n\nWithin one pixel of the estimated position, there was evidence of a\nsmall source.  We therefore convolved the image with a gaussian with a\nFWHM equal to that of the PSF (3.5 drizzled pixels).  This procedure\nuses the PSF as a matched filter to enhance the the signal-to-noise\nratio of unresolved sources.  In the convolved image an object is\nfound, again offset by one pixel from the expected position with a\nsignificance of ~4.5 sigma.  We estimate a magnitude (in the broad STIS\n50ccd filter) of V = 29.25 +/- 0.25.\n\nBloom et al., (1999, Nature, 401, 453) have suggested that the unusual\nlight curve of this GRB might be explained by an underlying supernova,\nand on the basis of this estimated a redshift of about z~1.   A\nsupernova at this redshift (which in this model peaks around a\nmagnitude of 25) would be expected to be significantly fainter than\nV=29 by now (as would the rapidly decaying GRB afterglow).  Therefore,\nwe may be detecting a faint host galaxy.  Deep HST images have in all\nother cases detected a host underlying the GRB, when good astrometry\nwas available for the GRB.  If we are observing a host galaxy, then the\nabove magnitude could underestimate its brightness by as much as a few\ntenths of a magnitude, due to extended emission missed in this\nmeasurement.  A galaxy at a z~1 with this observed magnitude would lie\na rather remarkable 7 magnitudes below L*, the knee of the of the\ngalaxy luminosity function at that redshift.\n\nGiven the apparent point-source nature of the detected object, and the\nlack of color information, we cannot exclude the possibility (which we\nconsider remote) that we are observing a light echo, from either the\nGRB or the supernova.\n\nImages of the field can be found at\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/980326","createdOn":985809183000,"email":"fruchter@stsci.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Valerie Connaughton at NASA/MSFC/USRA  <valerie@nasa.gov>","subject":"LIGO/Virgo G194575:  Fermi GBM Observations","circularId":18448,"bibcode":"2015GCN.18448....1B","body":"LIGO/Virgo G194575:  Fermi GBM Observations\n\nLindy Blackburn (CfA), Michael S.

CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the time of merger, Astrosat's nominal pointing is (RA=295.71, DEC=-10.36), which is 134.4 deg away from the maximum probability location. In a time interval of 100 sec around the event, 51% of sky locations are visible in the satellite's frame and the rest of 49% with the inclusion of maximum probability location for the event are occulted by earth. \n\nCZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from three of the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count rates were estimated by using data from 10 (+-5) neighbouring orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in a 1000 sec window is 10^-4.We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.\n\nWe convert our count rates into flux by assuming that the source spectrum is a power law with alpha = -1.0. We use a detailed mass model of the satellite to calculate the instrument response for every htm grid point that fall in 90% LIGO localization region and calculate flux limit in that direction. We get the following upper limits for source flux in the 20-200 keV band by taking a probability weighted mean of flux limit and are reported here :  \n\n0.1 s: flux limit= 8.7 e-7 ergs/cm^2/s \n1.0 s: flux limit= 3.0 e-6 ergs/cm^2/s \n10.0 s: flux limit= 3.6 e-6 ergs/cm^2/s\n\nCZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL.

CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the time of merger, Astrosat's nominal pointing is (RA=295.71, DEC=-10.36), which is 134.4 deg away from the maximum probability location. In a time interval of 100 sec around the event, 51% of sky locations are visible in the satellite's frame and the rest of 49% with the inclusion of maximum probability location for the event are occulted by earth. \n\nCZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from three of the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count rates were estimated by using data from 10 (+-5) neighbouring orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in a 1000 sec window is 10^-4.We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.\n\nWe convert our count rates into flux by assuming that the source spectrum is a power law with alpha = -1.0. We use a detailed mass model of the satellite to calculate the instrument response for every htm grid point that fall in 90% LIGO localization region and calculate flux limit in that direction. We get the following upper limits for source flux in the 20-200 keV band by taking a probability weighted mean of flux limit and are reported here :  \n\n0.1 s: flux limit= 8.7 e-7 ergs/cm^2/s \n1.0 s: flux limit= 3.0 e-6 ergs/cm^2/s \n10.0 s: flux limit= 3.6 e-6 ergs/cm^2/s\n\nCZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL.

The total exposure time was 7080\nseconds in the 50CCD aperture. The images were reduced by the standard\nHST pipeline, and drizzled to a combined image with a pixelscale of\n0.\"0254.\n\nWe projected the location of the early afterglow from a KeckII/LRIS R\nband image, taken by Filippenko, Leonard and Riess on March 27, 1998\n(see GCN 33).  We estimate the 1-sigma error radius to be less than 1.5\ndrizzled HST pixels, which includes both the scatter in the\ntransformation (0.9 pixels, using 6 reference stars) and the\nmeasurement error of the transient in the Keck image (0.8 pixels).\n\nWithin one pixel of the estimated position, there was evidence of a\nsmall source.  We therefore convolved the image with a gaussian with a\nFWHM equal to that of the PSF (3.5 drizzled pixels).  This procedure\nuses the PSF as a matched filter to enhance the the signal-to-noise\nratio of unresolved sources.  In the convolved image an object is\nfound, again offset by one pixel from the expected position with a\nsignificance of ~4.5 sigma.  We estimate a magnitude (in the broad STIS\n50ccd filter) of V = 29.25 +/- 0.25.\n\nBloom et al., (1999, Nature, 401, 453) have suggested that the unusual\nlight curve of this GRB might be explained by an underlying supernova,\nand on the basis of this estimated a redshift of about z~1.   A\nsupernova at this redshift (which in this model peaks around a\nmagnitude of 25) would be expected to be significantly fainter than\nV=29 by now (as would the rapidly decaying GRB afterglow).  Therefore,\nwe may be detecting a faint host galaxy.  Deep HST images have in all\nother cases detected a host underlying the GRB, when good astrometry\nwas available for the GRB.  If we are observing a host galaxy, then the\nabove magnitude could underestimate its brightness by as much as a few\ntenths of a magnitude, due to extended emission missed in this\nmeasurement.  A galaxy at a z~1 with this observed magnitude would lie\na rather remarkable 7 magnitudes below L*, the knee of the of the\ngalaxy luminosity function at that redshift.\n\nGiven the apparent point-source nature of the detected object, and the\nlack of color information, we cannot exclude the possibility (which we\nconsider remote) that we are observing a light echo, from either the\nGRB or the supernova.\n\nImages of the field can be found at\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/980326","createdOn":985809183000,"email":"fruchter@stsci.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Andrew S.

The bursts have a significantly\nharder spectrum (power law photon index ~0 in the 2-10 keV range).\n\nPulsations,  with a nearly sinusoidal light curve and a modulation of\nabout 21%, are clearly detected at the barycentered period  P=5.17277(1) s.\nWhen compared with the value measured with Chandra about 3 days later\n(GCN #1049), this yields a dP/dt ~ (4.1 +/- 1.9)x10^-10 s/s.\n\nAn additional BeppoSAX/NFI observation will start on April 29, 20:30 UT.\"\n\nThis message may be cited.","createdOn":988388763000,"email":"feroci@ias.rm.cnr.it"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"D.

The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL [2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.\n\nS231206cc is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-35 Hz, or about one in 1e27 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S231206cc\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), NSBH (<1%), BNS (<1%), or Terrestrial (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassgap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 30 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2.

This seeming storm of XRBs is being produced by an \nensemble of ~10 distinct XRB sources, which are optimally placed in \nthe HETE field-of-view (FOV) for detectability.\n\nThis dramatic overall increase is due to two factors: 1) Improvements \nin the on-board detection algorithm, resulting from lowered trigger \nthresholds and increased numbers of trigger time scales being \nactivated; 2) Sco X-1 has moved out of the HETE instruments' FOV, \ngreatly reducing the overall background, thus improving the \ninstruments' burst detection efficiency.\n\n(NB: Despite the flurry of XRBs, soft gamma repeaters [SGR] and \ngamma-ray bursts [GRB] positions are now being, and will continue to \nbe, reported for events which trigger the high energy bands of the \nFREGATE instrument directly.)\n\nMany of the faint XRB detections are near threshold, and thus their \nonboard localization is unreliable.

Many people\nare wondering what is going on.  This announcement attempts to explain\nthe recent developments.\n\nTRIGGERS:\nStarting about a week ago, the HETE Operations team resumed sending\nthe HETE messages from the s/c to GCN -- there were gaps due to HETE and due\nto GCN (the network problems).  And since the Galactic Center\nis still in the HETE FOV, this has caused a marked step increase\nin the amount of HETE Notices (from zero to several per day).\nThis increase has been further enhanced by the fact that Sco X-1 has left\nthe FOV of the HETE instruments two weeks ago.  The decrease in the background\ndue to the loss of Sco X-1 has increased the sensitivity to the the XRB\nsources in the Galactic Center.\n\nPOSITIONS:\nSince a larger fraction of these triggers is caused by X-ray Burst sources\nwhich are very weak, they produce poor image detections and therefore\nlocations with large uncertainites.  The HETE Operations team\nhas commanded the s/c to suppress the positions if the \"source\"\nin the image is not significant enough.  This results in the large\nnumber of Notices with no positions.\n\nFILTERING:\nI have changed the GCN filtering system to compensate for this change\nin the Notice content.  If there is no position in the S/C_Update,\nS/C_Last, or even the Gnd_Analysis messages, then they are NOT distributed\nthe sites requesting HETE Notices.  The reasoning is that with no position\ninformation in the Notice, what possible use could a follow-up observer\nmake of the notification.  This change was made Saturday, 28 Jul 01.\n\nTOO MANY ALERTS?\nHowever, the S/C_Alerts never were intended to have position information\n(except for rare instances (~10%)), so they are still being distributed\nto those sites that have requested the HETE S/C_Alert subtype.\nEven with the filtering of the U/L/GA's that have no positions, there are\nstill a large number of Alert Notices being distributed to sites.  If you feel\nthat you are receiving too many Alerts (that subsequently have no U/L/GA\nfollow-ups), then you might consider requesting that the Alert subtype\nbe disabled for your site.  (Or you might consider \"toughing it out\"\nfor another 4-6 weeks until the Galactic Center is no longer in the HETE FOV \nin which case the trigger rate should drop dramatically.)\n\nACTION ITEM:\nSites can:\n1) keep their current configurations,   or\n2) request that S/C_Alerts be disabled,   or\n3) request that S/C_Alerts/Updates/Lasts be disabled (say for the next month\nor so, and then request they be turned back on),   or\n4) request that all HETE subtypes (A/U/L/GA) be disabled (again for the next\nmonth or so).\nGiven the no-positions-filtering incorporated last Saturday, choice \"2\"\nseems like a reasonable approach if a site has any concern about \"too many\nNotices\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Barthelmy\nNASA-GSFC\n301-286-3106\nscott@lheamail.gsfs.nasa.gov","createdOn":996530269000,"email":"scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Luigi Piro at IAS/CNR Frascati  <piro@ias.rm.cnr.it>","subject":"GRB010412: refined positions from BeppoSAX","circularId":1035,"bibcode":"2009GCN.10035....1L","body":"GRB010412: refined positions\n\n\nRefined  coordinates from WFC are:\n\nR.A.(2000)= 294.913\nDEC.(2000)= 13.618\n\nThe error radius  is 6'.\n\nLuigi Piro\nBeppoSAX Mission Scientist","createdOn":987159388000,"email":"piro@ias.rm.cnr.it"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"SAX Science Operations at IAS/CNR Frascati  <saxsci@ias.rm.cnr.it>","subject":"GRB980613 BeppoSAX-NFI follow up","circularId":104,"bibcode":"2009GCN.10004....1D","body":"GRB980613: follow-up with NFI:\n\nLuigi Piro on behalf of the BeppoSAX team report:\n\n\nTwo previously unknown X-ray sources have been found in the WFC error\ncircle by the MECS during the follow up observation started 9 hrs after\nthe GRB.\n\nSource A is at\nR.A.(2000)= 10h17m53s\nDec.(2000)= +71d27'24\"\n\nSource B is at\nR.A.(2000)= 10h18m04s\nDec.(2000)= +71d33'30\"\n\nThe error radius is 50\".\n\nSource B does not show substantial variability.\nSource A shows a rather strong decay during the observation, and is very\nlikely the X-ray afterglow of GB980613.","createdOn":897952217000,"email":"saxsci@ias.rm.cnr.it"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Alberto Castro-Tirado at LAEFF-INTA  <ajct@laeff.esa.es>","subject":"GRB 980613 optical/IR obs.","circularId":102,"bibcode":"2009GCN.10002....1H","body":"Alberto J.

Vreeswijk report for a larger collaboration:\n\nThe field of GRB 000301c was reobserved by the Hubble Space Telescope\nusing the STIS camera in open (50CCD) mode on the 25 Feb 2001, or\nnearly one year after outburst.   Twelve dithered exposures were\ncombined to produce a final image with an exposure time of 7031s.\n\nNo source is immediately visible at the position of the GRB.  However,\nwhen the image is convolved with gaussians or boxcars with\ncharacteristic sizes from that of the PSF, 0.\"08, to 0.\"2, an extended\nobject appears to be visible under the position of the GRB and to its\nNE.  Although extended light from both a nearby bright star, and the\nlarger galaxy to the NW of the GRB make an exact determination of the\nsignificance of this object difficult, we believe this is approximately\na 3-4 sigma detection.  The probable host has an estimated magnitude of\nR = 28.0 +/- 0.3.  This magnitude is just consistent with the estimates\nof an underlying host from our earlier imaging, GCN 627 and 701.  It\nis, furthermore, about two magnitudes brighter than we would expect the\nOT to have been at this time, had it continued to decline with a\ntemporal power-law steeper than -2 (c.f. GCN 701 and  Rhoads and\nFruchter, ApJ 2001, 546, 177).\n\nIf this is indeed a detection of a host, then in all cases where we\nhave obtained a deep HST image and an OT is well localized (to ~0.\"1),\na host has been found under the GRB.   However, again, due to the\nscattered and extended light in this region of the image, the detection\nmust be considered tentative.\n\nThe image can be seen at http://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/000301C","createdOn":991165718000,"email":"fruchter@stsci.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Aaron Zimmerman at U. of Texas at Austin <aaron.zimmerman@utexas.edu>","submittedHow":"web","subject":"LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S231231ag: Updated Sky localization and Source Classification","circularId":35446,"bibcode":"2023GCN.35446....1Z","body":"The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration report:\n\nWe have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) data around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S231231ag (GCN Circular 35445).

Ricker (MIT), on behalf of the HETE Team, reports:\n\nOver the past few weeks, the number of X-ray bursts (XRBs) reported \nby HETE has been gradually increasing, reaching ~10 per day during \nthe past 2-3 days. This seeming storm of XRBs is being produced by an \nensemble of ~10 distinct XRB sources, which are optimally placed in \nthe HETE field-of-view (FOV) for detectability.\n\nThis dramatic overall increase is due to two factors: 1) Improvements \nin the on-board detection algorithm, resulting from lowered trigger \nthresholds and increased numbers of trigger time scales being \nactivated; 2) Sco X-1 has moved out of the HETE instruments' FOV, \ngreatly reducing the overall background, thus improving the \ninstruments' burst detection efficiency.\n\n(NB: Despite the flurry of XRBs, soft gamma repeaters [SGR] and \ngamma-ray bursts [GRB] positions are now being, and will continue to \nbe, reported for events which trigger the high energy bands of the \nFREGATE instrument directly.)\n\nMany of the faint XRB detections are near threshold, and thus their \nonboard localization is unreliable. In order not to saturate rapid \nresponse telescopes and observing programs which primarily target \nSGRs and GRBs, these XRB events are being reported to the GCN with no \npositions. (In fact, reliable positions are subsequently established \nby the WXM ground software for a large fraction of these XRB events.) \nA  refined reporting algorithm, which will more clearly distinguish \nfainter, poorly-localized XRBs from brighter, well-localized XRBs \nwill be implemented in the near future. In the meantime, the XRB \n\"alert only\" reports will continue.

At about 3\" to the East from the OT position an extended\nemission is clearly seen. This extended emission is most likely the galaxy\nseen in early HST image (see Price et al., 2001, ApJ, 549, L7) and its\nassociation with the host is unclear.\n\nThe exposure times and magnitudes of the object are:\n\n Filter  Exposure (sec.)

CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the time of merger, Astrosat's nominal pointing is (RA=295.71, DEC=-10.36), which is 134.4 deg away from the maximum probability location. In a time interval of 100 sec around the event, 51% of sky locations are visible in the satellite's frame and the rest of 49% with the inclusion of maximum probability location for the event are occulted by earth. \n\nCZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from three of the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count rates were estimated by using data from 10 (+-5) neighbouring orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in a 1000 sec window is 10^-4.We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.\n\nWe convert our count rates into flux by assuming that the source spectrum is a power law with alpha = -1.0. We use a detailed mass model of the satellite to calculate the instrument response for every htm grid point that fall in 90% LIGO localization region and calculate flux limit in that direction.

CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the time of merger, Astrosat's nominal pointing is (RA=295.71, DEC=-10.36), which is 134.4 deg away from the maximum probability location. In a time interval of 100 sec around the event, 51% of sky locations are visible in the satellite's frame and the rest of 49% with the inclusion of maximum probability location for the event are occulted by earth. \n\nCZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from three of the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count rates were estimated by using data from 10 (+-5) neighbouring orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in a 1000 sec window is 10^-4.We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.\n\nWe convert our count rates into flux by assuming that the source spectrum is a power law with alpha = -1.0. We use a detailed mass model of the satellite to calculate the instrument response for every htm grid point that fall in 90% LIGO localization region and calculate flux limit in that direction. We get the following upper limits for source flux in the 20-200 keV band by taking a probability weighted mean of flux limit and are reported here :  \n\n0.1 s: flux limit= 8.7 e-7 ergs/cm^2/s \n1.0 s: flux limit= 3.0 e-6 ergs/cm^2/s \n10.0 s: flux limit= 3.6 e-6 ergs/cm^2/s\n\nCZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL.

Many people\nare wondering what is going on.  This announcement attempts to explain\nthe recent developments.\n\nTRIGGERS:\nStarting about a week ago, the HETE Operations team resumed sending\nthe HETE messages from the s/c to GCN -- there were gaps due to HETE and due\nto GCN (the network problems).  And since the Galactic Center\nis still in the HETE FOV, this has caused a marked step increase\nin the amount of HETE Notices (from zero to several per day).\nThis increase has been further enhanced by the fact that Sco X-1 has left\nthe FOV of the HETE instruments two weeks ago.  The decrease in the background\ndue to the loss of Sco X-1 has increased the sensitivity to the the XRB\nsources in the Galactic Center.\n\nPOSITIONS:\nSince a larger fraction of these triggers is caused by X-ray Burst sources\nwhich are very weak, they produce poor image detections and therefore\nlocations with large uncertainites.  The HETE Operations team\nhas commanded the s/c to suppress the positions if the \"source\"\nin the image is not significant enough.  This results in the large\nnumber of Notices with no positions.\n\nFILTERING:\nI have changed the GCN filtering system to compensate for this change\nin the Notice content.  If there is no position in the S/C_Update,\nS/C_Last, or even the Gnd_Analysis messages, then they are NOT distributed\nthe sites requesting HETE Notices.  The reasoning is that with no position\ninformation in the Notice, what possible use could a follow-up observer\nmake of the notification.  This change was made Saturday, 28 Jul 01.\n\nTOO MANY ALERTS?\nHowever, the S/C_Alerts never were intended to have position information\n(except for rare instances (~10%)), so they are still being distributed\nto those sites that have requested the HETE S/C_Alert subtype.\nEven with the filtering of the U/L/GA's that have no positions, there are\nstill a large number of Alert Notices being distributed to sites.  If you feel\nthat you are receiving too many Alerts (that subsequently have no U/L/GA\nfollow-ups), then you might consider requesting that the Alert subtype\nbe disabled for your site.  (Or you might consider \"toughing it out\"\nfor another 4-6 weeks until the Galactic Center is no longer in the HETE FOV \nin which case the trigger rate should drop dramatically.)\n\nACTION ITEM:\nSites can:\n1) keep their current configurations,   or\n2) request that S/C_Alerts be disabled,   or\n3) request that S/C_Alerts/Updates/Lasts be disabled (say for the next month\nor so, and then request they be turned back on),   or\n4) request that all HETE subtypes (A/U/L/GA) be disabled (again for the next\nmonth or so).\nGiven the no-positions-filtering incorporated last Saturday, choice \"2\"\nseems like a reasonable approach if a site has any concern about \"too many\nNotices\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Barthelmy\nNASA-GSFC\n301-286-3106\nscott@lheamail.gsfs.nasa.gov","createdOn":996530269000,"email":"scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Fermi GBM Team at MSFC/Fermi-GBM  <do_not_reply@GIOC.nsstc.nasa.gov>","subject":"GRB 190610B: Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization","circularId":24777,"bibcode":"2019GCN.24777....1T","body":"The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB\n\nAt 17:59:49 UT on 10 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190610B (trigger 581882394.908204 / 190610750).\n\nThe on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 327.4, Dec = 42.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 21h 49m, 42d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 1.2 degrees.\n\nThe angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 19.0 degrees.\n\nThe skymap can be found here:\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2019/bn190610750/quicklook/glg_skymap_all_bn190610750.png\n\nThe HEALPix FITS file, including the estimated localization systematic, can be found here:\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2019/bn190610750/quicklook/glg_healpix_all_bn190610750.fit\n\nThe GBM light curve can be found here:\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2019/bn190610750/quicklook/glg_lc_medres34_bn190610750.gif","createdOn":1560190272000,"email":"do_not_reply@GIOC.nsstc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Israel Martinez-Castellanos at UMD/HAWC  <imc@umd.edu>","subject":"LIGO/Virgo S190602aq: No counterpart candidates in HAWC observations","circularId":24718,"bibcode":"2019GCN.24718....1T","body":"The HAWC Collaboration (https://www.hawc-observatory.org) reports:\n\nThe HAWC Collaboration performed a follow-up of the gravitational wave\ntrigger S190602aq.

The total exposure time was 7080\nseconds in the 50CCD aperture. The images were reduced by the standard\nHST pipeline, and drizzled to a combined image with a pixelscale of\n0.\"0254.\n\nWe projected the location of the early afterglow from a KeckII/LRIS R\nband image, taken by Filippenko, Leonard and Riess on March 27, 1998\n(see GCN 33).  We estimate the 1-sigma error radius to be less than 1.5\ndrizzled HST pixels, which includes both the scatter in the\ntransformation (0.9 pixels, using 6 reference stars) and the\nmeasurement error of the transient in the Keck image (0.8 pixels).\n\nWithin one pixel of the estimated position, there was evidence of a\nsmall source.  We therefore convolved the image with a gaussian with a\nFWHM equal to that of the PSF (3.5 drizzled pixels).  This procedure\nuses the PSF as a matched filter to enhance the the signal-to-noise\nratio of unresolved sources.  In the convolved image an object is\nfound, again offset by one pixel from the expected position with a\nsignificance of ~4.5 sigma.  We estimate a magnitude (in the broad STIS\n50ccd filter) of V = 29.25 +/- 0.25.\n\nBloom et al., (1999, Nature, 401, 453) have suggested that the unusual\nlight curve of this GRB might be explained by an underlying supernova,\nand on the basis of this estimated a redshift of about z~1.   A\nsupernova at this redshift (which in this model peaks around a\nmagnitude of 25) would be expected to be significantly fainter than\nV=29 by now (as would the rapidly decaying GRB afterglow).  Therefore,\nwe may be detecting a faint host galaxy.  Deep HST images have in all\nother cases detected a host underlying the GRB, when good astrometry\nwas available for the GRB.  If we are observing a host galaxy, then the\nabove magnitude could underestimate its brightness by as much as a few\ntenths of a magnitude, due to extended emission missed in this\nmeasurement.  A galaxy at a z~1 with this observed magnitude would lie\na rather remarkable 7 magnitudes below L*, the knee of the of the\ngalaxy luminosity function at that redshift.\n\nGiven the apparent point-source nature of the detected object, and the\nlack of color information, we cannot exclude the possibility (which we\nconsider remote) that we are observing a light echo, from either the\nGRB or the supernova.\n\nImages of the field can be found at\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/980326","createdOn":985809183000,"email":"fruchter@stsci.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>","subject":"SGR1900+14 - correction","circularId":1054,"bibcode":"2001GCN..1054....1H","body":"In GCN 1053, the date should read 2001 April 17 and 18, not 2000 April 17 and 18.","createdOn":988386763000,"email":"khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Valerie Connaughton at NASA/MSFC/USRA  <valerie@nasa.gov>","subject":"LIGO/Virgo G194575:  Fermi GBM Observations","circularId":18448,"bibcode":"2015GCN.18448....1B","body":"LIGO/Virgo G194575:  Fermi GBM Observations\n\nLindy Blackburn (CfA), Michael S.

This\nlocation is 66 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT\nerror circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;\nthe latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We\ncannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (3.87 x\n10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 5.8\n(+3.64/-2.97) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).\n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 105 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a candidate afterglow in\nthe rapidly available 2.7'x2.7' sub-image at\n  RA(J2000)  =\t10:13:31.54 = 153.38141\n  DEC(J2000) = +11:32:03.4  =  11.53429\nwith a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.77 arc sec. This position is 4.4\narc sec. from the center of the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude is\n18.33 with a 1-sigma error of about  0.15. No correction has been made for the\nexpected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.040.\n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is S.

Sinapius (DESY)  on behalf of the Fermi-LAT collaboration:\n\nWe report an analysis of observations of the vicinity of the IceCube-HAWC coincidence alert (GCN#37614) with all-sky survey data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The HAWC event was detected in a 6.06 hours interval from  2024-09-26 at 13:12:19 UT (T0)  to 2024-09-26 at 19:01:26 UT with J2000 position RA = 149.97  deg, Decl. = 46.22 deg  and a 90% PSF containment of 0.41 deg. One cataloged >100 MeV gamma-ray source is located within the 90% NuEm-240926A localization error, at a distance of roughly 0.12 deg (Fourth Fermi-LAT catalog, 4FGL-DR4, The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2023, arXiv:2307.12546). This is the object 4FGL J0959.6+4606 likely associated with the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy SDSS J095909.51+460014.3 (Li et al. 2023, A&A, 676, A9). Based on a preliminary analysis of the LAT data over the-timescales of 6.06 hours, 1-day and 1-month prior to T0, this object is not significantly detected at gamma-rays.\n\nWe searched for short (hours to month) timescale emission from a new gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the NuEm-240926A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the NuEm-240926A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 2.8e-7 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~6.06 hours, < 1.0e-7  ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-day and < 4.6e-9 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month integration time before T0.\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue. For these observations, the Fermi-LAT contact person is Patrik M. Veres (veres at astro.ruhr-uni-bochum.de). The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.","createdOn":1728394191288}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S241007bw","submitter":"Tomasz Baka at Nikhef, Utrecht University <t.baka@uu.nl>","submittedHow":"web","subject":"LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S241007bw: Identification of a GW compact binary merger candidate","circularId":37727,"format":"text/plain","bibcode":"2024GCN.37727....1L","body":"The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration report:\n\nWe identified the compact binary merger candidate S241007bw during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1), LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1), and Virgo Observatory (V1) at 2024-10-07 08:29:43.193 UTC (GPS time: 1412325001.193). The candidate was found by the cWB [1], cWB BBH [2], GstLAL [3], and MBTA [4] analysis pipelines.\n\nS241007bw is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.6e-08 Hz, or about one in 1 year, 11 months. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S241007bw\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (99%), Terrestrial (1%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [5] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [5] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state for maximum neutron star mass. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassGap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [6], distributed via GCN notice about 32 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [6], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,2 sky map, the 90% credible region is 967 deg2.

Swift slewed immediately to the burst.\nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 304.794, -40.796 which is \n   RA(J2000) = 20h 19m 11s\n   Dec(J2000) = -40d 47' 44\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex\nstructure with a duration of about 30 sec.  The peak count rate\nwas ~700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~-1 sec after the trigger.\n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 21:54:23.5 UT, 145.3 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,\nuncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 304.74258,\n-40.80514 which is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 20h 18m 58.22s\n   Dec(J2000) = -40d 48' 18.5\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment).

This position may be improved as more data are\nreceived; the latest position is available at\nhttps://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source\nis fading at the present time. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (4.92 x\n10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3.5\n(+3.24/-2.77) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). \n\nThe initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 4.75e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10\nkeV).\n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 349 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of\nthe XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated\non-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically\ncomplete to about 18 mag.

We started observations in the g- and r-band beginning at 2024-10-08 07:00 UTC, approximately 32.4 hours after event time. We covered 76.0% (1.3 sq deg) of the reported localization region. This estimate accounts for chip gaps. Each exposure was 300s with a typical depth of 21.0 mag. \n \nThe images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019, Stein et al. 2021) was used to search the alerts database for candidates. We reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects, and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019).

This source is also listed in milliquas (Flesch 2023) as a likely QSO (p=98%). This AGN has been detected previously by ZTF, and does not appear to currently be in an elevated optical state. It had been gradually fading in difference image detections for the past 60 days, and these represent minor fluctations relative to the archival PS1 magnitude of g=18.6 (Chambers et al. 2016). \n\nZTF24ablklut was first detected on 2024-10-08. It has a cross-matched detection as WISEA J035249.06+083946.1 at a distance of  0.19\". Based on the archival MIR colours of this source (W1-W2=1.0), this object is very likely to be an AGN (Stern et al. 2012). The recent optical detection is very faint in difference imaging, representing a small increase relative to the archival detection in PS1 at r=20.5 (Chambers et al. 2016).\n\nWe therefore find no reason to suggest that either ZTF19accjndb/WISEA J035434.54+083452.2 or ZTF24ablklut/WISEA J035249.06+083946.1 are related to the neutrino.\n\nObservations of this field will continue as part of our standard ToO cadence for high-energy neutrinos (Stein et al 2023.).\n\nZTF and GROWTH are worldwide collaborations comprising Caltech, USA; IPAC, USA; WIS, Israel; OKC, Sweden; JSI/UMd, USA; DESY, Germany; TANGO, Taiwan; UW Milwaukee, USA; LANL, USA; TCD, Ireland; IN2P3, France.\n\nGROWTH acknowledges generous support of the NSF under PIRE Grant No 1545949.\nAlert distribution service provided by DIRAC@UW (Patterson et al. 2019).\nAlert database searches are done by AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019).\nAlert filtering is performed with the nuztf (Stein et al. 2021, https://github.com/desy-multimessenger/nuztf ).","createdOn":1728420424577}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"GRB 241010A","submitter":"Phil Evans at U of Leicester <pae9@star.le.ac.uk>","submittedHow":"email","subject":"GRB 241010A: Enhanced Swift-XRT position","circularId":37757,"bibcode":"2024GCN.37757....1E","body":"P.A.

The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-241006A is 1.3e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 2e+02 GeV and 1e+05 GeV.\n\nA subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2024-10-05 22:38:14.300 UTC to 2024-10-07 22:38:14.300 UTC).

The observation consisted of two consecutive observations of 4x1200 s each, with mid-times at 03:53:33 UT and 05:18:58 UT on 2024 October 1 (~40.4 days after the trigger).

The candidate was found by the GstLAL [1], MBTA [2], PyCBC Live [3], and SPIIR [4] analysis pipelines.\n\nS241009an is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-12 Hz, or about one in 1e4 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S241009an\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [5] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [5] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state for maximum neutron star mass. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassGap) is 2%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [6], distributed via GCN notice about 37 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [6], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,1 sky map, the 90% credible region is 542 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 1208 +/- 365 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).\n\nFor further information about analysis methodology and the contents of this alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Public Alerts User Guide https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/.\n\n [1] Tsukada et al.

Excluding the event that prompted the alert, one track-like event is found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-Cascade 241019A. We find that this additional event is well described by atmospheric background expectations, with a p-value of 0.05 (which doesn’t account for statistical trials). The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-Cascade 241019A ranges from 1.3e-01 to 7.4e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 3e+02 GeV and 3e+06 GeV. \n\nA subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2024-10-18 23:28:59.840 UTC to 2024-10-20 23:28:59.840 UTC). In this search we report a p-value of 0.04, without accounting for statistical trials. This is consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-Cascade 241019A ranges from 1.5e-01 to 7.5e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window. \n\nThe best-fit position for a potential source producing the cascade and the track-like events in the two-day search is RA: 171.4 deg, Dec: -16.6 deg (J2000), with an estimated error radius of 0.5 deg at 90% containment.

We used the FORS2 spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT1 (Antu), equipped with the 300V grism and no order-sorting filter. Two spectra by 20 min each were secured, with mean epoch 2024 Oct 24.229 UT (about 3.01 days after the trigger). Seeing conditions were excellent at 0.5\", as measured in the acquisition image.\n\nIn the acquisition image (taken 2.998 days after the trigger), we measure a preliminary magnitude r = 22.06 +- 0.05 (AB, calibrated against nearby objects from Pan-STARRS).\n\nContinuum is detected at least across the range 4600-8600 AA. A strong emission line is visible at 6519 AA, which we identify as due to [O II] 3728 AA at z = 0.75. This interpretation is confirmed by the detection of a doublet in absorption at 4897 AA, which matches well Mg II at z = 0.748.\n\nWe note the persistently flat light curve of the optical counterpart (Fu et al., GCN 37840, 37842; Li et al., GCN 37844, 37846; Ror et al., GCN 37845; Moskvitin & Spiridonova, GCN 37850; our own acquisition measurement), which is unusual for a GRB afterglow over such a long time range.

The average 0.5-4 keV spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power law with a photon index of 2.5(+/-0.8) (with a column density fixed at the Galactic value of 3.38 x 10^21 cm^-2). The derived average unabsorbed 0.5-4 keV flux is 1.2(-0.3, +0.4) x 10^(-10) erg/s/cm^2.

A preliminary analysis of the EP-WXT data shows that the transient began at 2024-10-26T22:41:28 (UTC), and lasted for around 150 seconds, with the peak flux of around 8 x 10^-9 erg/s/cm^2 in 0.5-4 keV.

Using\nthe most recent data, we find that OT of GRB 010222 is clearly superposed\non a host galaxy.  \n\nIn order to accurately determine the decay of the OT and the magnitude\nof the host, we have drizzled the images onto an output grid that\nallows interlacing of these 2-point dithered images.  We have then fit\nfor the decay of the OT and the host galaxy flux using a small (~0.\"2)\naperture, which provides the best estimate of the OT as a function of\ntime, as well as using a larger aperture (~0.\"5), which is more\nappropriate for determining the host galaxy magnitude.\n\nWe find that the late-time decay of the OT is significantly steeper\nthan previously reported.  We find a power-law decay between 28 February\n(day 6) and 5 May (day 71) of -1.7 +/- 0.05.  Formally, we find\na slightly steeper decay (-1.73 +/- 0.02) in F606W than in F814W \n(-1.64 +/- 0.04), but this discrepancy may indicate the level of\nsystematic error in the slope measurement rather than true color\nevolution of the OT.\n\nWe find that the host galaxy is dominated by a compact core (FWHM ~ 0.\"15)\nlocated directly under the OT.

The total exposure time was 7080\nseconds in the 50CCD aperture. The images were reduced by the standard\nHST pipeline, and drizzled to a combined image with a pixelscale of\n0.\"0254.\n\nWe projected the location of the early afterglow from a KeckII/LRIS R\nband image, taken by Filippenko, Leonard and Riess on March 27, 1998\n(see GCN 33).  We estimate the 1-sigma error radius to be less than 1.5\ndrizzled HST pixels, which includes both the scatter in the\ntransformation (0.9 pixels, using 6 reference stars) and the\nmeasurement error of the transient in the Keck image (0.8 pixels).\n\nWithin one pixel of the estimated position, there was evidence of a\nsmall source.  We therefore convolved the image with a gaussian with a\nFWHM equal to that of the PSF (3.5 drizzled pixels).  This procedure\nuses the PSF as a matched filter to enhance the the signal-to-noise\nratio of unresolved sources.  In the convolved image an object is\nfound, again offset by one pixel from the expected position with a\nsignificance of ~4.5 sigma.  We estimate a magnitude (in the broad STIS\n50ccd filter) of V = 29.25 +/- 0.25.\n\nBloom et al., (1999, Nature, 401, 453) have suggested that the unusual\nlight curve of this GRB might be explained by an underlying supernova,\nand on the basis of this estimated a redshift of about z~1.   A\nsupernova at this redshift (which in this model peaks around a\nmagnitude of 25) would be expected to be significantly fainter than\nV=29 by now (as would the rapidly decaying GRB afterglow).  Therefore,\nwe may be detecting a faint host galaxy.  Deep HST images have in all\nother cases detected a host underlying the GRB, when good astrometry\nwas available for the GRB.  If we are observing a host galaxy, then the\nabove magnitude could underestimate its brightness by as much as a few\ntenths of a magnitude, due to extended emission missed in this\nmeasurement.  A galaxy at a z~1 with this observed magnitude would lie\na rather remarkable 7 magnitudes below L*, the knee of the of the\ngalaxy luminosity function at that redshift.\n\nGiven the apparent point-source nature of the detected object, and the\nlack of color information, we cannot exclude the possibility (which we\nconsider remote) that we are observing a light echo, from either the\nGRB or the supernova.\n\nImages of the field can be found at\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/980326","createdOn":985809183000,"email":"fruchter@stsci.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Kevin Hurley at UCBerkeley/SSL  <khurley@sunspot.ssl.berkeley.edu>","subject":"SGR1900+14","circularId":1053,"bibcode":"2009GCN.10053....1X","body":"K.

The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL [2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.\n\nS231206cc is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-35 Hz, or about one in 1e27 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S231206cc\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), NSBH (<1%), BNS (<1%), or Terrestrial (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassgap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 30 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2.

Examination of the\nlight curve reveals that at least one burst was observed, 9081 s after\nthe start of the observation.  Assuming the best-fit spectral\nparameters for the observation (see below), the peak 1-s flux of this\nburst was of order 5e-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.5-10 keV).\n\nSpectral fits to the full background-subtracted data set allow for at\nleast two emission models.  A power-law plus absorption model has\nbest-fit parameters of N_H = 3.18(2)e22 cm^-2, photon index alpha =\n2.70(1), and unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of 4.20(4)e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1.\nA power-law plus blackbody and absorption model has best-fit\nparameters of N_H = 2.56(2)e22 cm^-2, photon index alpha = 1.88(1),\nblackbody temperature kT = 0.532(3) keV, unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of\n2.17(3)e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and flux fraction for the blackbody\ncomponent of 29% (0.5-10 keV).

This seeming storm of XRBs is being produced by an \nensemble of ~10 distinct XRB sources, which are optimally placed in \nthe HETE field-of-view (FOV) for detectability.\n\nThis dramatic overall increase is due to two factors: 1) Improvements \nin the on-board detection algorithm, resulting from lowered trigger \nthresholds and increased numbers of trigger time scales being \nactivated; 2) Sco X-1 has moved out of the HETE instruments' FOV, \ngreatly reducing the overall background, thus improving the \ninstruments' burst detection efficiency.\n\n(NB: Despite the flurry of XRBs, soft gamma repeaters [SGR] and \ngamma-ray bursts [GRB] positions are now being, and will continue to \nbe, reported for events which trigger the high energy bands of the \nFREGATE instrument directly.)\n\nMany of the faint XRB detections are near threshold, and thus their \nonboard localization is unreliable. In order not to saturate rapid \nresponse telescopes and observing programs which primarily target \nSGRs and GRBs, these XRB events are being reported to the GCN with no \npositions. (In fact, reliable positions are subsequently established \nby the WXM ground software for a large fraction of these XRB events.) \nA  refined reporting algorithm, which will more clearly distinguish \nfainter, poorly-localized XRBs from brighter, well-localized XRBs \nwill be implemented in the near future.

The coordinates (J2000) of the 2 \nJuly burst are:\n\nR.A. = 286.846 (19h07m23s.1)\n\nDec. =  +9.344 (+9o20'40\")\n\nThe error circle for this localization is 12 arcmin in radius. \nSGR1900+14 lies 4.1 arcmin from the HETE position.\n\nThe burst duration in the 8-40 keV band was ~4 s. A total of 44000 \ncounts above background were detected during that interval, \ncorresponding to a fluence of ~8 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 . The peak flux \nwas >7 x 10-6 ergs cm-2 s-1 (ie >200 x Crab flux) over a duration of \n10 ms.\n\nFollow-up observations of this transient are encouraged.\n\nAdditional information on this burst detection (including light \ncurves), as well as for the HETE mission, will be available at:\n\nhttp://space.mit.edu/HETE/\n\nAcronyms: HETE=High Energy Transient Explorer\nFREGATE=French Gamma Ray Telescope\nWXM=Wide Field X-ray Monitor\nSXC=Soft X-ray Camera\n\nThis message is citeable.","createdOn":994051790000,"email":"grr@space.mit.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Aaron Zimmerman at U. of Texas at Austin <aaron.zimmerman@utexas.edu>","submittedHow":"web","subject":"LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S231224e: Updated Sky localization and Source Classification","circularId":35424,"bibcode":"2023GCN.35424....1Z","body":"The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration report:\n\nWe have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) data around the time of the compact binary merger (CBC) candidate S231224e (GCN Circular 35423).

Ricker (MIT), on behalf of the HETE Team, reports:\n\nOver the past few weeks, the number of X-ray bursts (XRBs) reported \nby HETE has been gradually increasing, reaching ~10 per day during \nthe past 2-3 days. This seeming storm of XRBs is being produced by an \nensemble of ~10 distinct XRB sources, which are optimally placed in \nthe HETE field-of-view (FOV) for detectability.\n\nThis dramatic overall increase is due to two factors: 1) Improvements \nin the on-board detection algorithm, resulting from lowered trigger \nthresholds and increased numbers of trigger time scales being \nactivated; 2) Sco X-1 has moved out of the HETE instruments' FOV, \ngreatly reducing the overall background, thus improving the \ninstruments' burst detection efficiency.\n\n(NB: Despite the flurry of XRBs, soft gamma repeaters [SGR] and \ngamma-ray bursts [GRB] positions are now being, and will continue to \nbe, reported for events which trigger the high energy bands of the \nFREGATE instrument directly.)\n\nMany of the faint XRB detections are near threshold, and thus their \nonboard localization is unreliable. In order not to saturate rapid \nresponse telescopes and observing programs which primarily target \nSGRs and GRBs, these XRB events are being reported to the GCN with no \npositions. (In fact, reliable positions are subsequently established \nby the WXM ground software for a large fraction of these XRB events.) \nA  refined reporting algorithm, which will more clearly distinguish \nfainter, poorly-localized XRBs from brighter, well-localized XRBs \nwill be implemented in the near future.

Many people\nare wondering what is going on.  This announcement attempts to explain\nthe recent developments.\n\nTRIGGERS:\nStarting about a week ago, the HETE Operations team resumed sending\nthe HETE messages from the s/c to GCN -- there were gaps due to HETE and due\nto GCN (the network problems).  And since the Galactic Center\nis still in the HETE FOV, this has caused a marked step increase\nin the amount of HETE Notices (from zero to several per day).\nThis increase has been further enhanced by the fact that Sco X-1 has left\nthe FOV of the HETE instruments two weeks ago.  The decrease in the background\ndue to the loss of Sco X-1 has increased the sensitivity to the the XRB\nsources in the Galactic Center.\n\nPOSITIONS:\nSince a larger fraction of these triggers is caused by X-ray Burst sources\nwhich are very weak, they produce poor image detections and therefore\nlocations with large uncertainites.  The HETE Operations team\nhas commanded the s/c to suppress the positions if the \"source\"\nin the image is not significant enough.  This results in the large\nnumber of Notices with no positions.\n\nFILTERING:\nI have changed the GCN filtering system to compensate for this change\nin the Notice content.  If there is no position in the S/C_Update,\nS/C_Last, or even the Gnd_Analysis messages, then they are NOT distributed\nthe sites requesting HETE Notices.  The reasoning is that with no position\ninformation in the Notice, what possible use could a follow-up observer\nmake of the notification.  This change was made Saturday, 28 Jul 01.\n\nTOO MANY ALERTS?\nHowever, the S/C_Alerts never were intended to have position information\n(except for rare instances (~10%)), so they are still being distributed\nto those sites that have requested the HETE S/C_Alert subtype.\nEven with the filtering of the U/L/GA's that have no positions, there are\nstill a large number of Alert Notices being distributed to sites.  If you feel\nthat you are receiving too many Alerts (that subsequently have no U/L/GA\nfollow-ups), then you might consider requesting that the Alert subtype\nbe disabled for your site.  (Or you might consider \"toughing it out\"\nfor another 4-6 weeks until the Galactic Center is no longer in the HETE FOV \nin which case the trigger rate should drop dramatically.)\n\nACTION ITEM:\nSites can:\n1) keep their current configurations,   or\n2) request that S/C_Alerts be disabled,   or\n3) request that S/C_Alerts/Updates/Lasts be disabled (say for the next month\nor so, and then request they be turned back on),   or\n4) request that all HETE subtypes (A/U/L/GA) be disabled (again for the next\nmonth or so).\nGiven the no-positions-filtering incorporated last Saturday, choice \"2\"\nseems like a reasonable approach if a site has any concern about \"too many\nNotices\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Barthelmy\nNASA-GSFC\n301-286-3106\nscott@lheamail.gsfs.nasa.gov","createdOn":996530269000,"email":"scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Michael Bremer at IRAM Grenoble  <bremer@iram.fr>","subject":"Millimeter observation of SGR 1900+14","circularId":1050,"bibcode":"2009GCN.10050....1B","body":"Millimeter observations of SGR 1900+14\n----------------------------------------\nM.

The total exposure time was 7080\nseconds in the 50CCD aperture. The images were reduced by the standard\nHST pipeline, and drizzled to a combined image with a pixelscale of\n0.\"0254.\n\nWe projected the location of the early afterglow from a KeckII/LRIS R\nband image, taken by Filippenko, Leonard and Riess on March 27, 1998\n(see GCN 33).  We estimate the 1-sigma error radius to be less than 1.5\ndrizzled HST pixels, which includes both the scatter in the\ntransformation (0.9 pixels, using 6 reference stars) and the\nmeasurement error of the transient in the Keck image (0.8 pixels).\n\nWithin one pixel of the estimated position, there was evidence of a\nsmall source.  We therefore convolved the image with a gaussian with a\nFWHM equal to that of the PSF (3.5 drizzled pixels).  This procedure\nuses the PSF as a matched filter to enhance the the signal-to-noise\nratio of unresolved sources.  In the convolved image an object is\nfound, again offset by one pixel from the expected position with a\nsignificance of ~4.5 sigma.

A\nsupernova at this redshift (which in this model peaks around a\nmagnitude of 25) would be expected to be significantly fainter than\nV=29 by now (as would the rapidly decaying GRB afterglow).  Therefore,\nwe may be detecting a faint host galaxy.  Deep HST images have in all\nother cases detected a host underlying the GRB, when good astrometry\nwas available for the GRB.

Many people\nare wondering what is going on.  This announcement attempts to explain\nthe recent developments.\n\nTRIGGERS:\nStarting about a week ago, the HETE Operations team resumed sending\nthe HETE messages from the s/c to GCN -- there were gaps due to HETE and due\nto GCN (the network problems).  And since the Galactic Center\nis still in the HETE FOV, this has caused a marked step increase\nin the amount of HETE Notices (from zero to several per day).\nThis increase has been further enhanced by the fact that Sco X-1 has left\nthe FOV of the HETE instruments two weeks ago.  The decrease in the background\ndue to the loss of Sco X-1 has increased the sensitivity to the the XRB\nsources in the Galactic Center.\n\nPOSITIONS:\nSince a larger fraction of these triggers is caused by X-ray Burst sources\nwhich are very weak, they produce poor image detections and therefore\nlocations with large uncertainites.  The HETE Operations team\nhas commanded the s/c to suppress the positions if the \"source\"\nin the image is not significant enough.  This results in the large\nnumber of Notices with no positions.\n\nFILTERING:\nI have changed the GCN filtering system to compensate for this change\nin the Notice content.  If there is no position in the S/C_Update,\nS/C_Last, or even the Gnd_Analysis messages, then they are NOT distributed\nthe sites requesting HETE Notices.  The reasoning is that with no position\ninformation in the Notice, what possible use could a follow-up observer\nmake of the notification.  This change was made Saturday, 28 Jul 01.\n\nTOO MANY ALERTS?\nHowever, the S/C_Alerts never were intended to have position information\n(except for rare instances (~10%)), so they are still being distributed\nto those sites that have requested the HETE S/C_Alert subtype.\nEven with the filtering of the U/L/GA's that have no positions, there are\nstill a large number of Alert Notices being distributed to sites.  If you feel\nthat you are receiving too many Alerts (that subsequently have no U/L/GA\nfollow-ups), then you might consider requesting that the Alert subtype\nbe disabled for your site.  (Or you might consider \"toughing it out\"\nfor another 4-6 weeks until the Galactic Center is no longer in the HETE FOV \nin which case the trigger rate should drop dramatically.)\n\nACTION ITEM:\nSites can:\n1) keep their current configurations,   or\n2) request that S/C_Alerts be disabled,   or\n3) request that S/C_Alerts/Updates/Lasts be disabled (say for the next month\nor so, and then request they be turned back on),   or\n4) request that all HETE subtypes (A/U/L/GA) be disabled (again for the next\nmonth or so).\nGiven the no-positions-filtering incorporated last Saturday, choice \"2\"\nseems like a reasonable approach if a site has any concern about \"too many\nNotices\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nScott Barthelmy\nNASA-GSFC\n301-286-3106\nscott@lheamail.gsfs.nasa.gov","createdOn":996530269000,"email":"scott@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"INTEGRAL Shift Ops at INTEGRAL  <shift@isdcmail.unige.ch>","subject":"GRB021219: Correction to GCN 1766","circularId":1769,"bibcode":"2002GCN..1769....1I","body":"Due to a typing mistake the GRB declination in GCN 1766\nwas reported as  +31deg 52s.\nThe correct value is  +31deg 52min\nThere was also a spelling error in the name of J.Borkowski","createdOn":1040322241000,"email":"shift@isdcmail.unige.ch"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Fermi GBM Team at MSFC/Fermi-GBM  <do_not_reply@GIOC.nsstc.nasa.gov>","subject":"GRB 190608A: Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization","circularId":24769,"bibcode":"2019GCN.24769....1T","body":"The Fermi GBM team reports the detection of a likely LONG GRB\n\nAt 00:12:18 UT on 8 Jun 2019, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered and located GRB 190608A (trigger 581645543.394168 / 190608009).\n\nThe on-ground calculated location, using the Fermi GBM trigger data, is RA = 225.7, Dec = -31.4 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 15h 02m, -31d 23'), with a statistical uncertainty of 2.2 degrees.\n\nThe angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 71.0 degrees.\n\nThe skymap can be found here:\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2019/bn190608009/quicklook/glg_skymap_all_bn190608009.png\n\nThe HEALPix FITS file, including the estimated localization systematic, can be found here:\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2019/bn190608009/quicklook/glg_healpix_all_bn190608009.fit\n\nThe GBM light curve can be found here:\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2019/bn190608009/quicklook/glg_lc_medres34_bn190608009.gif","createdOn":1559953444000,"email":"do_not_reply@GIOC.nsstc.nasa.gov"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Valerie Connaughton at NASA/MSFC/USRA  <valerie@nasa.gov>","subject":"LIGO/Virgo G194575:  Fermi GBM Observations","circularId":18448,"bibcode":"2015GCN.18448....1B","body":"LIGO/Virgo G194575:  Fermi GBM Observations\n\nLindy Blackburn (CfA), Michael S.

CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the time of merger, Astrosat's nominal pointing is (RA=295.71, DEC=-10.36), which is 134.4 deg away from the maximum probability location. In a time interval of 100 sec around the event, 51% of sky locations are visible in the satellite's frame and the rest of 49% with the inclusion of maximum probability location for the event are occulted by earth. \n\nCZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from three of the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count rates were estimated by using data from 10 (+-5) neighbouring orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in a 1000 sec window is 10^-4.We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.\n\nWe convert our count rates into flux by assuming that the source spectrum is a power law with alpha = -1.0.

The observation consisted of 4 spectra of 1200 s each, obtained with grism R1000B, covering the spectral range between 3650 and 7800 AA, at a resolving power of 600.\n\nThe acquisition image, obtained on 2024-10-31 at 02:42:33 UT, 8.14 hr since the trigger, shows the afterglow at r(AB) = 23.53 +/- 0.12 mag, as compared to Pan-STARRS field stars.\n\nThe spectrum shows a faint continuum over the complete spectral range, though a drop in flux is observed blueward of ~4700 AA, suggesting the onset of the Lyman-alpha forest. No clear DLA trough is visible, but several, low S/N absorption features are present to the red of the drop, which we tentatively interpret as Si II 1526, Si IV 1393, C IV 1548,1550 (blended), Al II 1670, Al III 1854,1862 at z = 2.82, which we propose as the redshift of GRB 241030B.","createdOn":1730375640174}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Vladimir Lipunov at Moscow State U/Krylov Obs <lipunov@xray.sai.msu.ru>","submittedHow":"email-legacy","subject":"Fermi  trigger No 752006065: Global MASTER-Net observations report","circularId":38005,"body":"V.

The candidate was found by the GstLAL [1] analysis pipeline.\n\nS241101ee is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.4e-11 Hz, or about one in 1e3 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S241101ee\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [2] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [2] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state for maximum neutron star mass. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassGap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 32 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,1 sky map, the 90% credible region is 9938 deg2.

The WXT position of EP241101a is R.A.= 37.763 deg, DEC = 22.731 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 2.8 arcmin (radius, 90% C.L. statistical and systematic). The light curve of the transient observed by the WXT lasts more than 100 seconds. The average 0.5-4 keV spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 0.9 (+0.6/-0.6) (with the column density fixed at the Galactic value of 1.5x10^21 cm^-2).

The delay of the FXT observation was due to the Earth obscuration. No significant source was detected by the FXT during its autonomous observation within the WXT error circle, thus we obtained a flux upper limit of 7.1 x 10^(-14) erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.5-10 keV.

The transient flare started at 2024-11-03T01:23:37 (UTC) and lasted for around 60 seconds. The average 0.5-4 keV spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power law with a photon index of 0.8+/-0.4 (with N_H, the neutral hydrogen column density, fixed at the Galactic value of 6.3×10^20 cm^-2). The derived average unabsorbed 0.5-4 keV flux is 3.8 (+1.1/-0.9)×10^(-9) erg/s/cm^2, while the peak flux of the flare is found to be around 1.1×10^(-8) erg/s/cm^2. The uncertainties are at the 90% confidence level for the above parameters.\n\nThe EP-FXT autonomous follow-up observation started at 2024-11-03T01:28:50 (UTC).

During the 2,300-second exposure, no significant variation is observed in the light curve. We fit an absorbed power law model to the 0.5-10 keV energy spectrum with N_H fixed at the Galactic value.

The total exposure time was 7080\nseconds in the 50CCD aperture. The images were reduced by the standard\nHST pipeline, and drizzled to a combined image with a pixelscale of\n0.\"0254.\n\nWe projected the location of the early afterglow from a KeckII/LRIS R\nband image, taken by Filippenko, Leonard and Riess on March 27, 1998\n(see GCN 33).  We estimate the 1-sigma error radius to be less than 1.5\ndrizzled HST pixels, which includes both the scatter in the\ntransformation (0.9 pixels, using 6 reference stars) and the\nmeasurement error of the transient in the Keck image (0.8 pixels).\n\nWithin one pixel of the estimated position, there was evidence of a\nsmall source.  We therefore convolved the image with a gaussian with a\nFWHM equal to that of the PSF (3.5 drizzled pixels).  This procedure\nuses the PSF as a matched filter to enhance the the signal-to-noise\nratio of unresolved sources.  In the convolved image an object is\nfound, again offset by one pixel from the expected position with a\nsignificance of ~4.5 sigma.  We estimate a magnitude (in the broad STIS\n50ccd filter) of V = 29.25 +/- 0.25.\n\nBloom et al., (1999, Nature, 401, 453) have suggested that the unusual\nlight curve of this GRB might be explained by an underlying supernova,\nand on the basis of this estimated a redshift of about z~1.   A\nsupernova at this redshift (which in this model peaks around a\nmagnitude of 25) would be expected to be significantly fainter than\nV=29 by now (as would the rapidly decaying GRB afterglow).  Therefore,\nwe may be detecting a faint host galaxy.  Deep HST images have in all\nother cases detected a host underlying the GRB, when good astrometry\nwas available for the GRB.  If we are observing a host galaxy, then the\nabove magnitude could underestimate its brightness by as much as a few\ntenths of a magnitude, due to extended emission missed in this\nmeasurement.  A galaxy at a z~1 with this observed magnitude would lie\na rather remarkable 7 magnitudes below L*, the knee of the of the\ngalaxy luminosity function at that redshift.\n\nGiven the apparent point-source nature of the detected object, and the\nlack of color information, we cannot exclude the possibility (which we\nconsider remote) that we are observing a light echo, from either the\nGRB or the supernova.\n\nImages of the field can be found at\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/GRB/980326","createdOn":985809183000,"email":"fruchter@stsci.edu"}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Filippo Frontera at ITESRE CNR  <filippo@tesre.bo.cnr.it>","subject":"Giant flare from SGR1900+14","circularId":1041,"bibcode":"2001GCN..1041....1G","body":"C.Guidorzi, E.Montanari and F.Frontera, University of Ferrara, Italy;  E.\nCosta, G.Gandolfi, M.Feroci and L.Piro, IAS-CNR, Roma;  L.Amati, TESRE,\nCNR, Bologna; J.J.M. in 't Zand, SRON and Astronomical Institute, Utrecht,\nNL; G.

Observations began at 11:01 UT on 24 October\n2009 (~ 2.1 hours after the burst) and covered the wavelength range from ~\n3500 - 10000 A.\n\nIn addition to the features identified by Cucchiara, Fox, and Tanvir (CaII\nH & K, Mg I), we also find strong absorption features we identify as Mg\nII (2796 / 2803) and Fe II (2344, 2374, 2382, 2586, and 2600) at a common\nredshift of z = 1.091.

Excluding the event that prompted the alert, one track-like event is found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-Cascade 241019A. We find that this additional event is well described by atmospheric background expectations, with a p-value of 0.05 (which doesn’t account for statistical trials). The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-Cascade 241019A ranges from 1.3e-01 to 7.4e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 3e+02 GeV and 3e+06 GeV. \n\nA subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2024-10-18 23:28:59.840 UTC to 2024-10-20 23:28:59.840 UTC). In this search we report a p-value of 0.04, without accounting for statistical trials. This is consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-Cascade 241019A ranges from 1.5e-01 to 7.5e+00 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window. \n\nThe best-fit position for a potential source producing the cascade and the track-like events in the two-day search is RA: 171.4 deg, Dec: -16.6 deg (J2000), with an estimated error radius of 0.5 deg at 90% containment.

The candidate was found by the GstLAL [1] analysis pipeline.\n\nS241011k is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 2.5e-34 Hz, or about one in 1e26 years.

[2] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [2] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state for maximum neutron star mass. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassGap) is 3%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 28 seconds after the candidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1.

The VT conducted observations simultaneously in two channels: VT_B (400nm-650nm) and VT_R (650nm-1000nm).\n\nWith the VHF data started at 2024-10-18T12:00:28 UT, in which the cataloged source brighter than 21 mag is completed relative to the PS1 catalog. An uncatalogued source was found within the errorbox of Eclairs and has an angular distance of 1.8509 arcmin from the position of MXT (Maggi et al., 37814). \n\nThe position is RA=04:31:59, DEC=+43:01:12, error=1.0 arcsec, J2000.\n\nThe brightness of the source is fading rapidly in 10 min, from 20.9 mag to 22.2 mag for VT_B and from 18.7 mag to 20.5 mag for VT_R.\n\nWe proposed that this source might be the counterpart of the burst. More analysis is continuing with X-band data. \n\nFurther follow-ups are encouraged especially in red wavelength. \n\nThe Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a China-France joint mission led by the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA, China), National Center for Space Studies (CNES, France) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, China), which is dedicated to observing gamma-ray bursts and other transient phenomena in the energetic universe.

A preliminary analysis of the EP-WXT data shows that the transient began at 2024-10-26T22:41:28 (UTC), and lasted for around 150 seconds, with the peak flux of around 8 x 10^-9 erg/s/cm^2 in 0.5-4 keV.

The average unabsorbed flux is (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10^-9 erg/s/cm2 in 0.5-4 keV.

We used the FORS2 spectrograph mounted on the ESO VLT UT1 (Antu), equipped with the 300V grism and no order-sorting filter. Two spectra by 20 min each were secured, with mean epoch 2024 Oct 24.229 UT (about 3.01 days after the trigger). Seeing conditions were excellent at 0.5\", as measured in the acquisition image.\n\nIn the acquisition image (taken 2.998 days after the trigger), we measure a preliminary magnitude r = 22.06 +- 0.05 (AB, calibrated against nearby objects from Pan-STARRS).\n\nContinuum is detected at least across the range 4600-8600 AA. A strong emission line is visible at 6519 AA, which we identify as due to [O II] 3728 AA at z = 0.75. This interpretation is confirmed by the detection of a doublet in absorption at 4897 AA, which matches well Mg II at z = 0.748.\n\nWe note the persistently flat light curve of the optical counterpart (Fu et al., GCN 37840, 37842; Li et al., GCN 37844, 37846; Ror et al., GCN 37845; Moskvitin & Spiridonova, GCN 37850; our own acquisition measurement), which is unusual for a GRB afterglow over such a long time range. We encourage further photometric monitoring at all wavelengths.\n\nWe acknowledge the expert support from the ESO observing staff at Paranal, in particular Martina Baratella.","createdOn":1729765290834}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"GRB 241010A","submitter":"Priya Gokuldass at ERAU <gokuldap@my.erau.edu>","submittedHow":"web","subject":"GRB 241010A: VIRT Optical Upper Limit","circularId":37854,"format":"text/plain","bibcode":"2024GCN.37854....1S","body":"K.

These metal absorption features consistently indicate a redshift of z ~ 1.4, consistent with the Keck/LRIS result (Zheng et al., GCN 37959).\n\nWe acknowledge the staff at the Lijiang Observatory for conducting the observation.\n","editedOn":1730468099786,"createdOn":1730452237838,"version":2,"circularId":38027}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"A.

Carotenuto (INAF/OAR), J. Bright (Oxford), R. Fender (Oxford)\n\nAfter the first radio detection with ATCA (Ricci et al. GCN 37949), we observed the Fast X-ray Transient EP241021a (Hu et al. GCN 37834; Fu et al. GCN 37840, Wang et al. GCN 37848) with the Arcminute MicroKelvin Imager - Large Array for a total of 4.7 hours starting on 30 October 2024 at 20:59:50.7 UTC. 3C286 and J0149+0555 were used as flux and time dependent complex gain calibrators, respectively.\n\nWe obtained a significant detection of the target with a flux density of ~450 uJy/beam at a central frequency of 15.5 GHz. The rms noise in the field is ~75 uJy/beam. Further AMI-LA observations are planned.\n\nWe thank the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for operating and maintaining the AMI-LA.","createdOn":1730387581531}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","submitter":"Vladimir Lipunov at Moscow State U/Krylov Obs <lipunov@xray.sai.msu.ru>","submittedHow":"email-legacy","subject":"Fermi  trigger No 752006065: Global MASTER-Net observations report","circularId":38005,"bibcode":"2024GCN.38005....1L","body":"V.

Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued\nX-ray source located at RA, Dec 293.39935, 57.98544 which is equivalent\nto:\n   RA(J2000)  = 19h 33m 35.84s\n   Dec(J2000) = +57d 59' 07.6\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3.7 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment).

This position may be improved as more data are received;\nthe latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We\ncannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (8.92 x\n10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 4.4\n(+3.14/-2.68) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence).\n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 117 seconds after the BAT trigger.

Both are highly energetic and located at a redshift greater than 4 (GCN 37866, GCN 31353), which allows a zoom-in investigation due to cosmological expansion. By examining the onset of black hole formation and the ultra-relativistic prompt emission (UPE), we gain insight into the rotational dynamics within these systems. This investigation requires additional observational data, particularly optical emission measurements from the newly born pulsar and extended X-ray afterglow data up to more than 10^6 seconds. Concurrent monitoring by Fermi-LAT will be crucial for capturing high-energy emissions, while the already performed Fermi-GBM observations enable the identification of the jetted emission. On this basis, the energy extraction process from a newly formed black hole will be determine.\n","createdOn":1730290260079}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"GRB 241030A","submitter":"Brajesh Kumar at SWIFAR, YNU <brajesh@ynu.edu.cn>","submittedHow":"web","subject":"GRB 241030A: Multiband optical detection with Mephisto","circularId":37966,"format":"text/plain","bibcode":"2024GCN.37966....1L","body":"Weikang Lin (SWIFAR, YNU), Brajesh Kumar (SWIFAR, YNU), Guowang Du (SWIFAR, YNU), Yangwei Zhang (SWIFAR, YNU), Tao Wang (SWIFAR, YNU), Runnan Jiang (SWIFAR, YNU), Yaosong Yu (SWIFAR, YNU), Yu Pan (SWIFAR, YNU), Xingzhu Zou (SWIFAR, YNU), Xinlei Chen (SWIFAR, YNU), Jinghua Zhang (SWIFAR, YNU), Yuanpei Yang (SWIFAR, YNU), Yuan Fang (SWIFAR, YNU), Yehao Cheng (SWIFAR, YNU), Chenxu Liu (SWIFAR, YNU), Xuhui Han (NAOC), Pinpin Zhang (NAOC), Liping Xin (NAOC), Chao Wu (NAOC), Xiangkun Liu (SWIFAR, YNU), Xiaowei Liu (SWIFAR, YNU) report on behalf of the Mephisto Team:\n\nWe performed uvgriz band observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 241030A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 37955 and Swift/BAT, Klingler et al., GCN 37956), using the 1.6m Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) of Yunnan University located at Lijiang Observatory.

We further analyzed the data during the FXT's slew to the target before the observation commenced, an uncatalogued X-ray source was found at R.A. = 37.7526 deg, DEC = 22.7175 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of about 10 arcsecs (radius, 90% C.L. statistical and systematic). The slew observation began from 2024-11-01T23:54:21 (UTC), and observed the source from 2024-11-01T23:57:02 to 2024-11-01T23:58:02, which is from T0+253s to T0+313s (T0 = 2024-11-01T23:52:49). The spectrum of the source can be fitted by an absorbed power law with a photon index of 2.4(+/-0.4) (with a column density fixed at the Galactic one of 1.46 x 10^21 cm^-2), giving an average unabsorbed flux of 4.4(+0.7/-0.6) x 10^-11 erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.5-10 keV band. The FXT source is about 3 arcmin away from the optical candidate reported by Busmann et al. (GCN 38064), indicating that the optical source may not be associated with EP241101a.\n\nWe have conducted another FXT observation of EP241101a from T0+31.7ks to T0+43.7 ks with an exposure time of 6.5 ks. No significant source was detected within the WXT error circle, putting a flux upper limit of 1.5 x 10^(-14) erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.5-10 keV.\n\nGiven the rapid X-ray decay and the absence of an optical counterpart down to ~24.5 magnitude (Perez-Garcia et al., GCN 38047; Lipunov et al., GCN 38049; Adami et al., GCN 38060; Aryan et al., GCN 38061; Busmann et al., GCN 38064), we encourage further observations to determine the nature of the source.\n\nLaunched on January 9, 2024, EP is a space X-ray observatory to monitor the soft X-ray sky with on-board X-ray follow-up capability (Yuan et al. 2022, Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astrophysics).

The WXT position of EP241030a is R.A.= 32.574 deg, DEC = 31.555 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin (radius, 90% C.L. statistical and systematic).\n\nThe lightcurve of the transient observed by the WXT lasts around 400 seconds and has a peak flux of ~5.0 x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.5-4 keV band. The average 0.5-4 keV spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power law with a photon index of 1.3(-0.7, +0.8) and a fixed absorbing column density value of 7.8 x 10^20 cm^-2. The derived average unabsorbed 0.5-4 keV flux is 2.0(-1.1, +1.0) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2.

The WXT position of EP241104a is R.A.= 32.574 deg, DEC = 31.555 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 2.7 arcmin (radius, 90% C.L. statistical and systematic).\n\nThe lightcurve of the transient observed by the WXT lasts around 400 seconds and has a peak flux of ~5.0 x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.5-4 keV band. The average 0.5-4 keV spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power law with a photon index of 1.3(-0.7, +0.8) and a fixed absorbing column density value of 7.8 x 10^20 cm^-2. The derived average unabsorbed 0.5-4 keV flux is 2.0(-1.1, +1.0) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2. The uncertainties are at the 90% confidence level for the above parameters. \n\nEP241104a is spatially and temporally consistent with GRB 241104A (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 38075; Vladimir et al., GCN 38076; Stéphane et al., GCN 38078). The EP-WXT detection is about 4 minutes after the Fermi-GBM trigger (2024-11-04T18:30:15).

Julakanti, G. Ramsay, B. P. Gompertz, K. Ackley, D. O'Neill, A. Kumar, R. Starling, M. J. Dyer, J. Lyman, K. Ulaczyk, F. Jimenez-Ibarra, D. Steeghs, D. K. Galloway, V. Dhillon, P. O'Brien, K. Noysena, R. Kotak, R. P. Breton, L. K. Nuttall, E. Palle and D. Pollacco report on behalf of the GOTO collaboration:\n\nWe report on optical observations with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO; Steeghs et al. 2022; Dyer et al. 2024) in response to the GRB 241105A (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 38085). Targeted imaging covered the Fermi localisation region from 2024-11-05 16:19:10 UT, (+0.22h post trigger) to 2024-11-05 17:42:50 UT (+1.61h post trigger). In total, 277.9 square degrees within the 90% contour were imaged, resulting in a coverage total of ~84.3% of the total 2D localisation probability. The observations consisted of 4x90s exposures in the GOTO L-band (400-700 nm). In total, 101 images were taken, across 10 unique pointings, with an average 5-sigma depth of 20.4 mag.\n\nImages were processed immediately after acquisition using the GOTO pipeline. Difference imaging was performed using deeper template observations. Source candidates were initially filtered using a classifier (Killestein et al. 2021) and cross-matched against a variety of contextual and minor planet catalogs. Human vetting was carried out in real time on any candidates that passed the above checks.\n\nA new optical source GOTO24ibf is identified within the GBM 90% localisation region. We find no evidence of the source down to 20.0 mag prior to the GRB trigger time in previous GOTO observations taken at 2024-11-05 10:48:54 UTC (t-t0 = -5.29h) or the ATLAS forced photometry server (Shingles et al. 2021). There is a faint ambiguous underlying source at the position of GOTO24ibf visible in DESI legacy survey images that we cannot definitively identify as a star or galaxy. Due to the onset of twilight at Siding Spring Observatory, only a single epoch of observations were obtained, preventing any assessment of the evolution of the source. We encourage further deeper follow-up observations.\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|  Internal name |  Time (UT) | t-t0 (h) | RA (J2000) |  Dec (J2000) |      Mag      |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n|  GOTO24ibf   | 2024-11-05 16:34:35  | 0.48 | 04:24:59.0 | -49:45:09.3 | 17.21 +/- 0.01 |\n\nMagnitudes were calibrated using ATLAS-REFCAT2 (Tonry et al. 2018) and are not corrected for Galactic extinction.\n\nGOTO (https://goto-observatory.org) is a network of telescopes that is principally funded by the STFC and operated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, Spain, and Siding Spring Observatory in NSW, Australia, on behalf of a consortium including the University of Warwick, Monash University, Armagh Observatory & Planetarium, the University of Leicester, the University of Sheffield, the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT), the University of Turku, the University of Portsmouth, the University of Manchester and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC).","createdOn":1730837875762}Topic: gcn.circulars, Message: {"$schema":"https://gcn.nasa.gov/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json","eventId":"GRB 241104A","submitter":"Daniele B.
